adept/adept_as work up to at least sp_n6000_0_600, but fail for sp_n8000_0_600 (with 2 GPUs), -> too much memory usage! (use: ulimit -v 100000000)
adept (and maybe other programs) fails for 5nt long protein -> --min-len 10 (? -> maybe it was because of non-standard aa)

adept (multi_gpu) uses as many gpus as reserved in SLURM header, -g parameter has no effect

cudasw: error with query profile variant (also if total query length < threshold (3355 for enode, 2516 for login5)) 
    CUDA error on GPU 0: invalid argument : src/CFastaSWScalar.cu, line 642

DEDAL: Figure S3: per sec: 4 TPU, ~10000 pairs, 300nt
CUDASW: per sec: 6 GPUs, ~1.2Mio pairs

Runtime comparisons: check CPU usage, check end time difference between chunks

Things/parameters to test:
- query/db size, find optimal dimensions for each programs
- chunksize parameter
- temporary directory (program_out, /tmp, /dev/shm)
- number of CPUs/GPUs, scale up to 24/6? (swipe probably not with program_out, but hopefully with tmpfs)
